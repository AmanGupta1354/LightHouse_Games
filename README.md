✨ *Welcome to the place where boredom dies and fun begins!*

## 🌟 **About the Project**

LightHouse_Games is my **personal fun lab** where I build multiplayer browser games, experiment with crazy ideas, and learn full-stack development while doing **cool stuff** instead of boring tutorials.

Think of this repo as a **gaming playground** built with code.
One brain, one keyboard, unlimited chaos. 😎⚡

## 🚀 **Features**

* ⚔️ Real-time multiplayer madness
* 🎭 Game rooms — join with friends or your own tabs
* ⚡ Fast & lightweight WebSocket action
* 🎨 Smooth UI that doesn’t burn your eyes
* 🧩 Easy to add more games because I write clean-ish code
* 📱 Works on phone, laptop, tablet… probably fridge too

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack (My Power-Ups)**

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript,React
* **Backend:** Node.js + Express
* **Realtime:** Socket.io (for magical connections)
* **Others:** Git, VS Code, a lot of coffee ☕
