## 🌟 **About the Project**

LightHouse_Games is a team-made game lab where we create multiplayer browser games, try wild ideas, break things, fix them again, and keep learning full-stack development while having fun.

This repo is our playground —
where three minds, one dream, and unlimited chaos come together. 😎⚡
